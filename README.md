# CIND 820- Capstone Project
**Online Shoppers Purchase Intention**

The dataset that will be used for this paper is the “Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention” dataset, it was obtained through UC Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository:
•	Dataset:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset 

This project aims to research the subject of Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention by building a predictive model using Classification algorithms, which shall predict and analyze a customer’s behaviour and intention of how likely they are to complete a purchase on an E-commerce Website after its visit.

The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 sessions (rows). The dataset was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period. 

This dataset will be analyzed in R-Studio and Python and will be used to build classification models to predict and analyze the customer’s online purchase intention. The performance and accuracy of these models will be compared and analyzed with the intention to predict whether a customer, after visiting an online shop for an e-commerce retailer will end up completing a purchase or not.
