This project aims to research the subject of Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention by building a predictive model using Classification algorithms, which shall predict and analyze a customer’s behaviour and intention of how likely they are to complete a purchase on an E-commerce Website after its visit.

The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 sessions (rows). The dataset was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period. 

This project is conformed by Classification models : Random Forest, XGBoost & Naive Bayes with the imbalanced dataset and a resample dataset.
